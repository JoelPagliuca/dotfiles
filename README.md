# dotfiles
Just a few shell commands for version controlling my dotfiles. There's already another project for this out there but I just wanted to make my own.

## Usage
dotfiles save|load

save - copies files to ~/.dotfiles
load - loads files from ~/.dotfiles

Use git to sync with the git server, I'll automate this later
